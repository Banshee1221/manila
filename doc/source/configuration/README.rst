==================================
Manila Configuration Documentation
==================================

Introduction:
-------------

This directory is intended to hold any documentation that relates to
how to configure Manila.  Some of this content will be automatically
generated in upcoming documentation work.  At the moment, however, it
is not.  Changes to configuration options for Manila or its drivers
need to be put under this directory.

The full spec for organization of documentation may be seen in the
`OS Manuals Migration Spec
<https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/docs-specs/specs/pike/os-manuals-migration.html>`_.
